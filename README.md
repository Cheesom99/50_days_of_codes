Well in those days, as a relative beginner in python. 
I understood the fact that I was meant to complete some projects that would give me more insights.
Nothing beats the hands on approach.
So I decided to do a mini project everyday for 50 days.
From Fibonnaci sequence in Day 1 to Sudoku on Day 50
In between, some challenges from various platforms were also completed.
