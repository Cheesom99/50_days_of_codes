SMALLEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NUMBERS IN AN ARRAY
An example of the array
Sort it
An empty list
New variables created


As far as we have not iterated more times than the length of the array
the diff between two consecutive numbers (it is sorted remember)
add it to the empty list
we increment i and j...
...to move on the next set of integers
increment count also by 1
the diff of each set of consecutive numbers is stored in the once empty list
JUST PRINT THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF THE LIST
